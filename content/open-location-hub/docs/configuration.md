All runtime configuration is environment-driven.

Runtime lifecycle behavior:
- the hub process runs from a single signal-aware root context created from `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM`
- startup failures return structured process errors instead of panicking during early config or logger initialization
- graceful shutdown uses a bounded timeout so HTTP shutdown and internal event-publisher fan-out can complete deterministically after a stop signal

## Core
- `HTTP_LISTEN_ADDR` (default `:8080`)
- `HTTP_REQUEST_BODY_LIMIT_BYTES` (default `4194304`)
- `LOG_LEVEL` (default `info`)
- `HUB_ID` (optional UUID bootstrap or reset value for the persisted hub identity)
- `HUB_LABEL` (optional bootstrap or reset value for the persisted human-readable hub label)
- `RESET_HUB_ID` (`true`/`false`, default `false`; when `true`, overwrite stored hub metadata with explicitly supplied env values)
- `POSTGRES_URL` (default `postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/openrtls?sslmode=disable`)
- `MQTT_BROKER_URL` (default `tcp://localhost:1883`)
- `WEBSOCKET_WRITE_TIMEOUT` (duration, default `5s`)
- `WEBSOCKET_READ_TIMEOUT` (duration, default `1m`)
- `WEBSOCKET_PING_INTERVAL` (duration, default `30s`)
- `WEBSOCKET_OUTBOUND_BUFFER` (default `256`)
- `EVENT_BUS_SUBSCRIBER_BUFFER` (default `1024`)
- `NATIVE_LOCATION_BUFFER` (default `2048`)
- `DERIVED_LOCATION_BUFFER` (default `1024`)

Hub metadata bootstrap behavior:
- the hub persists one durable metadata row in Postgres containing the stable `hub_id` and operator-facing label
- on first startup, `HUB_ID` seeds that row when provided; otherwise the hub generates a UUIDv7
- on first startup, `HUB_LABEL` seeds that row when provided; otherwise the hub defaults to the machine hostname and falls back to `open-rtls-hub` if hostname lookup is unavailable
- on later startups, the stored row is the source of truth when `HUB_ID` and `HUB_LABEL` are omitted
- if supplied env values disagree with the stored row, startup fails with a clear mismatch error unless `RESET_HUB_ID=true`
- when `RESET_HUB_ID=true`, only explicitly supplied values overwrite the stored row; omitted fields are preserved

HTTP request decoding behavior:
- JSON request bodies are capped by `HTTP_REQUEST_BODY_LIMIT_BYTES` before decode work proceeds
- the REST/RPC handler layer accepts exactly one JSON document per request body and rejects trailing JSON tokens
- unknown JSON object fields remain allowed so forwards-compatible clients are not rejected solely for extension data

## Stateful Processing
- `STATE_LOCATION_TTL` (duration, default `10m`)
- `STATE_PROXIMITY_TTL` (duration, default `5m`)
- `STATE_DEDUP_TTL` (duration, default `2m`)
- `METADATA_RECONCILE_INTERVAL` (duration, default `30s`)
- `RPC_TIMEOUT` (duration, default `5s`)
- `RPC_ANNOUNCEMENT_INTERVAL` (duration, default `1m`)
- `RPC_HANDLER_ID` (default `open-rtls-hub`)
- `COLLISIONS_ENABLED` (`true`/`false`, default `false`)
- `COLLISION_STATE_TTL` (duration, default `2m`)
- `COLLISION_COLLIDING_DEBOUNCE` (duration, default `5s`)
- `COLLISION_DEFAULT_RADIUS_METERS` (number, default `0.5`)
- `KALMAN_FILTER_ENABLED` (`true`/`false`, default `false`)
- `KALMAN_LOCATION_MAX_POINTS` (default `8`)
- `KALMAN_LOCATION_MAX_AGE` (duration, default `10s`)
- `KALMAN_EMIT_MAX_FREQUENCY_HZ` (number, default `0`; `0` means unlimited)

Stateful ingest behavior:
- duplicate location/proximity payloads inside `STATE_DEDUP_TTL` are suppressed in the in-memory processing state before fan-out work
- latest provider-source location state, trackable latest-location state, proximity hysteresis state, fence membership state, and collision pair state are all kept in process memory with the configured expiry semantics
- metadata is loaded from Postgres at startup, updated immediately after successful CRUD writes, and reconciled in the background every `METADATA_RECONCILE_INTERVAL`
- durable hub metadata is also loaded from Postgres at startup before the service begins accepting traffic
- WebSocket delivery uses a per-connection outbound queue capped by `WEBSOCKET_OUTBOUND_BUFFER`; when that queue fills, outbound payloads are dropped instead of backpressuring ingest or disconnecting the subscriber
- WebSocket liveness uses server ping frames every `WEBSOCKET_PING_INTERVAL` and considers the connection stale when no inbound message or pong arrives before `WEBSOCKET_READ_TIMEOUT`
- internal event-bus subscribers such as MQTT and WebSocket consume behind `EVENT_BUS_SUBSCRIBER_BUFFER`
- native location publication is queued behind `NATIVE_LOCATION_BUFFER` so ingest can decouple from transport fan-out
- post-native decision work such as future filtering, alternate-CRS publication, geofence evaluation, and collision evaluation is queued behind `DERIVED_LOCATION_BUFFER`
- when the native, decision, event-bus, or outbound socket queues are full, the hub drops newer work on those non-critical paths instead of slowing raw location ingest
- the `metadata_changes` WebSocket topic emits lightweight `{id,type,operation,timestamp}` notifications for zone, fence, trackable, and location-provider CRUD or reconcile drift
- when `COLLISIONS_ENABLED=true`, the hub evaluates trackable-versus-trackable collisions from the latest active motion state and keeps short-lived collision pair state in memory for `COLLISION_STATE_TTL`
- when `KALMAN_FILTER_ENABLED=true`, the decision stage keeps short-lived per-trackable filter state plus a bounded retained sample history in memory
- `KALMAN_LOCATION_MAX_POINTS` caps the retained history per trackable; `KALMAN_LOCATION_MAX_AGE` also drops stale samples and resets the filter when the gap between accepted samples exceeds that age window
- Kalman normalization only affects the derived decision path for trackable-associated locations; native/raw publication remains unchanged
- normalized derived locations may populate OMLOX-compatible `course` and `speed` from track movement and may add hub extension properties such as `kalman_normalized` and `kalman_vertical_speed`
- `KALMAN_EMIT_MAX_FREQUENCY_HZ` throttles only derived location and trackable-motion publication; geofence and collision decisions still use every accepted normalized point even when publication is suppressed
- when a WGS84 derived variant is available, collision work uses the normalized WGS84 motion state; when the source stream is local-only and no safe WGS84 transform exists, collision work falls back to the normalized local motion state
- collision thresholds are expressed in meters
- `Trackable.radius` is the per-trackable collision-radius override in meters; when it is absent, the hub falls back to `COLLISION_DEFAULT_RADIUS_METERS`
- WGS84 collision checks use a cheap short-range planar approximation that converts lon/lat deltas to approximate meters before threshold comparison; this favors hot-path throughput over geodesic precision
- fallback collision geometry for trackables without explicit polygon geometry uses the same meter-based approximation so emitted geometry remains consistent with the runtime threshold model
- `COLLISION_COLLIDING_DEBOUNCE` limits repeated `colliding` emissions for already-active pairs

RPC behavior:
- `RPC_TIMEOUT` is the default wait time for request-response style RPC calls when the client does not supply `_timeout`
- `RPC_ANNOUNCEMENT_INTERVAL` controls how often the hub republishes retained MQTT availability announcements for hub-owned methods
- `RPC_HANDLER_ID` is the handler identifier announced for hub-owned RPC methods and the identifier clients may use with `_handler_id` to target the hub directly
- `com.omlox.identify` returns the persisted hub label as `name` plus the stable `hub_id`

## Proximity Resolution
- `PROXIMITY_RESOLUTION_ENTRY_CONFIDENCE_MIN` (number, default `0`)
- `PROXIMITY_RESOLUTION_EXIT_GRACE_DURATION` (duration, default `15s`)
- `PROXIMITY_RESOLUTION_BOUNDARY_GRACE_DISTANCE` (number, default `2`)
- `PROXIMITY_RESOLUTION_MIN_DWELL_DURATION` (duration, default `5s`)
- `PROXIMITY_RESOLUTION_POSITION_MODE` (default `zone_position`; supported value: `zone_position`)
- `PROXIMITY_RESOLUTION_FALLBACK_RADIUS` (number, default `0`)
- `PROXIMITY_RESOLUTION_STALE_STATE_TTL` (duration, default `10m`)

Proximity resolution behavior:
- proximity updates are resolved to a zone before the hub emits a derived `Location`
- the first valid proximity observation enters immediately
- the hub keeps the current zone for a short grace period to reduce flapping between nearby zones
- zone-specific overrides may be supplied through `Zone.properties.proximity_resolution`
- `Proximity.properties` is preserved into derived location metadata but does not override configured policy

## Auth
- `AUTH_ENABLED` (`true`/`false`, default `true`)
- `AUTH_MODE` (`none|oidc|static|hybrid`, default `none`)
- `AUTH_ISSUER` (OIDC issuer URL)
- `AUTH_AUDIENCE` (comma-separated)
- `AUTH_ALLOWED_ALGS` (comma-separated, default `RS256`)
- `AUTH_STATIC_PUBLIC_KEYS` (comma-separated PEM blocks or JWKS URLs)
- `AUTH_CLOCK_SKEW` (duration, default `30s`)
- `AUTH_OIDC_REFRESH_TTL` (duration, default `10m`)
- `AUTH_HTTP_TIMEOUT` (duration, default `5s`)
- `AUTH_PERMISSIONS_FILE` (YAML path, default `config/auth/permissions.yaml`)
- `AUTH_ROLES_CLAIM` (JWT claim used for role extraction, default `groups`)
- `AUTH_OWNED_RESOURCES_CLAIM` (JWT object claim for owned resource IDs; see `docs/auth.md` for format and usage)

See [docs/auth.md](/open-location-hub/docs/auth/) for the full auth model, Dex setup, and permission file format.

## Telemetry
- `OTEL_ENABLED` (`true`/`false`, default `false`)
- `OTEL_METRICS_ENABLED` (`true`/`false`, default `true` when telemetry is enabled)
- `OTEL_TRACES_ENABLED` (`true`/`false`, default `true` when telemetry is enabled)
- `OTEL_LOGS_ENABLED` (`true`/`false`, default `true` when telemetry is enabled)
- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` (base OTLP HTTP endpoint such as `http://localhost:4318`)
- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT` (optional full traces endpoint override)
- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_ENDPOINT` (optional full metrics endpoint override)
- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_LOGS_ENDPOINT` (optional full logs endpoint override)
- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` (comma-separated `key=value` headers for collector auth or routing)
- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_INSECURE` (`true`/`false`, default `false`)
- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TIMEOUT` (duration, default `10s`)
- `OTEL_METRIC_EXPORT_INTERVAL` (duration, default `30s`)
- `OTEL_METRIC_EXPORT_TIMEOUT` (duration, default `10s`)
- `OTEL_TRACE_SAMPLE_RATIO` (number between `0` and `1`, default `1`)
- `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` (default `open-rtls-hub`)
- `OTEL_SERVICE_VERSION` (optional override for release tagging)
- `OTEL_DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT` (optional deployment environment label such as `local-demo` or `production`)
- `OTEL_DEBUG_IDENTIFIERS` (`true`/`false`, default `false`)

Telemetry behavior:
- the hub exports OTLP metrics, traces, and logs directly to a collector and does not expose a separate Prometheus scrape endpoint in this slice
- `service.name`, `service.version`, `deployment.environment`, and the persisted `hub.id` are attached to the OTel resource when available
- invalid telemetry configuration fails startup only when telemetry is enabled
- metrics are intentionally low-cardinality and are labeled only with bounded dimensions such as transport, signal type, stage, feature, and outcome
- entity identifiers such as `trackable_id`, `provider_id`, `zone_id`, `fence_id`, and collision pair identifiers are emitted on spans and structured logs for drill-down, not on normal metric series
- runtime metrics cover ingest acceptance and deduplication, end-to-end processing latency, queue occupancy and wait time, queue and outbound drop counters, fence evaluation, collision evaluation, MQTT/WebSocket publication, metadata reconcile, auth, and RPC outcomes
- the local demo stack under [`local-hub/`](https://github.com/Open-Location-Stack/open-location-hub/blob/main/local-hub) enables all three OTLP signals by default and routes them to SigNoz

## RPC Security Defaults

For production deployments:
- keep `AUTH_ENABLED=true`
- treat `GET /v2/rpc/available` as sensitive because it reveals reachable control functions
- use per-method RPC permissions in the auth registry to control who may invoke which methods
- grant `com.omlox.core.xcmd` only to tightly controlled operator or automation roles
- keep direct MQTT broker access limited to the hub and trusted device/adaptor components
